A simple script update CloudFlare DDNS for Synology NAS. This script can be integrated into Synology NAS UI.
It largely refers to [official CloudFlare's API example for Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/python-cloudflare/master/examples/example_update_dynamic_dns.py)

# Installation
1. Install python3 from synology package using the NAS web interface.
2. Enable the SSH connection and ssh into your NAS
3. Install pip for python3, then get python-cloudflare
```
sudo python3 -m ensurepip
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3 -m pip install python-cloudflare
```
4. Download the CloudFlareDDNS script from this repository. I personnaly prefer putting the script in /usr/local/bin/.
You can put whereever you want. Just remember the path.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lioujheyu/synocfddns/master/cloudflareDDNS.py
sudo mv cloudflareDDNS.py /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflareDDNS.py
```
5. (optional)
   You can firstly test the script's functionality. Running this script without any arguments gives the usage, like
 `cloudflareDDNS.py <username> <api_key> <hostname> <ip_address>`    
 `username` is your CloudFlare username, usually the email address you registered in CloudFlare. `api_key` is your personal CloudFlare API key. See [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-Cloudflare-API-key-) in how to retrive the key.
6. Integrate the script into Synology DDNS management interface by adding the following text into `/etc.defaults/ddns_provider.conf`
```
[Cloudflare]
        modulepath=/usr/local/bin/cloudflareDDNS.py
        queryurl=https://www.cloudflare.com/
```
7. Go to DDNS management page in your NAS web UI (control->external access->DDNS). Click Add. And select Cloudflare from the drop-down menu. Fill the three necessary fields which are hostname, username, and password(CloudFlare API Key).

That's it. See if the DDNS' IP has been updated in your Cloudflare page.
